# Remove Roblox URL Tracking

## Why have this?
Even if you have an adblocker and it blocks google analytics roblox can still track you though the tracking url parameters. This userscript/extension will automatically remove those parameters and provide you with the raw link to the destination you are going to.

## Contributing
If you have found any other url tracking methods this userscript/extension doesnt cover then feel free to open a new [issue request](https://github.com/ImFirstPlace/Remove-Roblox-URL-Tracking/issues/new) and let me know there!
